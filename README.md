# Maze_shortest_path_between_points
Find shortest path between two points. 
App is generating custom maze board based on user input size. 
The board is being created randomly using DFS algorithm.
Please find description of all the steps below:

1. Request from user a side of the maze, an integer N number.
2. Randomly generate a maze of NxN size, using # character as walls.
3. Randomly select Start and End points, marking them as S and E characters.
4. Find shortest path from Start to End points. Show the path with continues red line.
